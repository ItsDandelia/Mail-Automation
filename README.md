# Mail-Automation

This code is made to automate the sign-in process followed by the key pressings
that are necessary like 'compose','Clicking-on-buttons' to focus on them and 'Send' it also accesses the subject and 'To: emails' section.
All we need to provide is receiver's mails, subject and content along with date and time.
The scheduling part is also automated with the time and date that we provide.
delivering at time is done by GMail itself.
